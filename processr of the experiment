step by step process:


* select the Arduino. Uno board in tools, and also select the port:"com8"

* go to sketch in Arduino> go to include library >extract the cvzone.zip file.

* just go to files > select the examples > select the cvzone > select the Get.Led.

* now just verify the code and just upload it .
 

    Now python process:
     
   * Write the code according to the serial port number of the Arduino in visual studio.
   
(note : the code has been provided in the name of FaceDetection.Module.python.py )
 
    Match the serial port number 
  
in python have to write the line :
     # Initialize serial connection
   arduino = serial.Serial('COM8', 9600, timeout=1)
   time.sleep(2)  # Wait for connection to establish
