connection  :
  
  first the GND in Arduino to the negative in the board
   
  place the ohm resistor 
  
  connect the negative of the  green light led light to the resistor(with the help of jumper wires) 
 
  connect the positive terminal of the green light to the 13 pin in the Arduino. Uno(with the help of jumper wires)
  
  connect the negative of the red light to the resistor (with the help of jumper wires)
   
  connect the positive terminal of the red light to the 12 in the Arduino.Uno  (with the help of jumper wires)
